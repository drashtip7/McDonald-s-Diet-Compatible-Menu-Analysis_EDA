#### Sodium is a necessary mineral. But health organizations typically recommend that healthy adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg (about one teaspoon of salt) per day to prevent conditions like high blood pressure.

#### Of course, this menu recommendation is perfect for dieters who have an energy target of 1500 kCal a day to eat at McDonald’s. Not only to launch a weight loss diet, this will also fill the stomach with enough energy so that daily activities are not disturbed. However, this result is not absolutely accurate because the combined menu of food, drink, and condiment may not match each other.
